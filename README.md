- [ ] Constraints — PRIMARY KEY, FOREIGN KEY, UNIQUE, CHECK, DEFAULT, NOT NULL  

---

## 2. Core SQL Operations
- [ ] DDL (Data Definition Language) — CREATE, ALTER, DROP (tables, schemas, databases)  
- [ ] DML (Data Manipulation Language) — INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE  
- [ ] DQL (Data Query Language) — SELECT basics  
- [ ] Filtering Data — WHERE clause, comparison operators, logical operators  
- [ ] Sorting & Limiting Results — ORDER BY, LIMIT/TOP, DISTINCT  

---

## 3. Functions & Aggregations
- [ ] SQL Functions  
  - [ ] Aggregate: COUNT, SUM, AVG, MIN, MAX  
  - [ ] Scalar: CONCAT, LENGTH, ROUND, UPPER/LOWER, DATE functions  
- [ ] GROUP BY & HAVING Clauses  

---

## 4. Joins & Advanced Queries
- [ ] Joins — INNER JOIN, LEFT JOIN, RIGHT JOIN, FULL OUTER JOIN, CROSS JOIN, SELF JOIN  
- [ ] Subqueries — single-row, multi-row, correlated subqueries, nested queries  
- [ ] Set Operations — UNION, UNION ALL, INTERSECT, EXCEPT/MINUS  
- [ ] CASE Statements & Conditional Logic — IF-ELSE equivalents in SQL  

---

## 5. Views, Indexing & Performance
- [ ] Views — creating, updating, and using views  
- [ ] Indexes — clustered vs non-clustered, composite indexes, partial indexes  
- [ ] Query Performance Tuning Basics — execution plans, indexing strategy  

---

## 6. Transactions & Control
- [ ] Transactions & ACID Properties — atomicity, consistency, isolation, durability  
- [ ] TCL (Transaction Control Language) — COMMIT, ROLLBACK, SAVEPOINT  
- [ ] DCL (Data Control Language) — GRANT, REVOKE for permissions & roles  

---

## 7. CTEs, Window Functions & Procedures

- [ ] Window Functions — RANK, DENSE_RANK, ROW_NUMBER, LAG, LEAD  
- [ ] Stored Procedures — creation, parameters, returning results  
- [ ] Triggers — BEFORE, AFTER, INSTEAD OF triggers  

---

## 8. Database Design & Optimization
- [ ] Database Normalization — 1NF, 2NF, 3NF, BCNF
