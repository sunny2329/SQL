# Database Fundamentals
SQL is Structured Query Language.

A Database is a shared collection of logically related data with description of these data, designed to meet the information needs of an organization.

- Data Storage: A database is used to store large amounts of structured data, making it easily accessible, searchable, and retrievable.
- Data Analysis: A database can be used to perform complex data analysis, generate reports, and provide insights into the data.
- Record Keeping: A database is often used to keep track of important records, such as financial transactions, customer information, and inventory levels.
- Web Applications: Databases are an essential component of many web applications, providing dynamic content and user management.

Properties of an ideal database
- Integrity
- Availability
- Security
- Independent of Application
- Concurrency

  ## Types Of Databases

  1. Relational Databases: Also known as SQL databases, these databases use a relational model to organize data into tables with rows and columns.
  2. Nosql Databases: These databases are designed to handle large amounts of unstructured or semi-structured data, such as documents, images, or videos.
  3. Column Databases: These databases store data in columns rather than rows, making them well-suited for data warehousing and analytical applications. (Amazon, Redshift, Google BigQuery)
  4. Graph Databases: These databases are used to store and query graph-structured data, such as social network connections or recommendation systems.
  5. Key-value Databases: These databases store data as a collection of keys and values, making them well-suited for caching and simple data storage needs (Redis and Amazon DynamoDB)
